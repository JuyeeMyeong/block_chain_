Blockchain: a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network.
            It stores information electronically in digital format, mainly used in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions.
            It guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party to avoid double-spending.
