_ Blockchain _: a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network.
            It stores information electronically in digital format, mainly used in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions.
            It guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party to avoid double-spending.
            Here, the third party is a middle-main like a bank or government that intervenes in a transaction between the sender and recipient who are able to share the sensitive data they collect about you.

_ The Oracle Problem _: Blockchain itself cannot interact with the real world data and events.
_ Blockchain Oracle _: Any device that interacts with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts.
_ Decentralized Oracle Network _: As we cannot work with single oracle, we need decentralized oracle network which enables the creation of hybrid smart contracts, where on-chain code and off-chain infrastructure are combined to support advanced decentralized applications (dApps) that react to real-world events and interoperate with traditional systems.

_ Web1 _: The permissionless open sourced web with static content
_ Web2 _: The permissioned web, with dynamic content. Where companies run your agreements on their servers.
_ Web3 _: The permissionless web, with dynamic content. Where decentralized censorship resistant networks run your agreement and code.
          It generally is accompanied by the idea of user owned ecosystems, where the protocols you interact with you also own a portion of, instead of solely being the product.
   
<<A smart contract is...>>
* Immutable (cannot be altered)
* Automatically executes
* Everyone sees the terms of the agreement
* trust minimized agreements

<<Advantages>>
1. Decentralized (Many node operators run blockchains)
2. Transparency & Flexibility
3. Speed & Efficiency
4. Security & Immutability (as long as one node is alive, the data is safe)
5. Counterparty Risk Removal
6. Trust Minimized Agreements

<<What have smart contracts done so far>>
_ DeFi _: Decentralized Finance. It gives users the ability to engage with finance and markets without having to go through a centralized intermediary.
          For example, customers no longer have to trust that Robin Hood would continue to give you access to the markets, they instead would be able to see in the smart contract.
          (Over $200 value and it's growing)

_ DAOs _: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are groups that are governed completely decentralized by a set of instructions or smart contracts on chain.
          Engagements are much easier and people can dierectly see everything on chain voting and governance.

_ NFTs _: Non Fungible Tokens which can be described as digital art or just a unique asset.
